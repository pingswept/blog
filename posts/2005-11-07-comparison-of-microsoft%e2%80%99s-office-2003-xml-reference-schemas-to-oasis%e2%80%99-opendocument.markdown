title: "Comparison of Microsoft\xE2\x80\x99s Office 2003 XML Reference Schemas to OASIS\xE2\x80\x99 OpenDocument"
---
In the dispute with the Massachusetts state government over their planned adoption of the OpenDocument format, Microsoft <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/preview/developers/fileoverview.mspx">has claimed</a> that their Open XML formats, which they recently announced will be the default format for the pending Office 12, will be "published and made available under the same royalty-free license that exists for the Microsoft Office 2003 Reference Schemasâ€”openly offered and available for broad industry use." While the 2003 Reference Schemas specifications are freely available (for example, the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/wordxmlcdk/html/cdkPrimerPlaceholder_HV01113631.asp">Word 2003 XML Reference</a>) under a royalty-free license, saying that the specifications are "openly offered" is disingenuous.
Microsoft has patented techniques used to in their "open" formats. The license for the specifications <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/mscorp/ip/format/xmlpatentlicense.asp">includes a patent license</a>, which states that "Except as provided below, Microsoft hereby grants you a royalty-free license under Microsoft's Necessary Claims to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import, and otherwise distribute Licensed Implementations solely for the purpose of reading and writing files that comply with the Microsoft specifications for the Office Schemas." Unfortunately, the provisions below include: "You are not licensed to sublicense or transfer your rights."
The last clause precludes, for example, writing a program that uses the new formats and then letting your friend tweak the code to do something else. Your friend might make your code do something that wasn't "solely for the purpose of reading and writing files that comply with the Microsoft specifications," and even if he didn't, you can't transfer your royalty-free license to Microsoft's patents to him.
Handily, this eliminates all of the GPL software in the world.
On the other hand, the OASIS OpenDocument format is truly open. Its specification is <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/12572/OpenDocument-v1.0-os.pdf">available from OASIS</a>, which <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/who/intellectualproperty.php">guarantees</a> that the OpenDocument license is royalty free. <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/who/ipr/intellectual_property_2000-1-13.php">Furthermore</a>, "By ratifying this document, OASIS warrants that it will not inhibit the traditional open and free access to OASIS documents for which license and right have been assigned according to the procedures set forth in this section. This warrant is perpetual and will not be revoked by OASIS or its successors or assigns." Additionally, Sun Microsystems, one of the companies involved in the development of the standard, has stated that it will not assert its patents as they relate to the standard.
