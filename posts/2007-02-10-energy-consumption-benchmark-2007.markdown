title: Personal energy consumption benchmark 2007
---
As of the start of 2007, I am living in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and commuting 16 miles round trip by car at 35 mpg to <a href="http://www.greenmountainengineering.com">GreenMountain Engineering</a> in Waltham 250 days/year. That's about 125 gallons of diesel per year, and I drive an additional 20% for other reasons. That's around 150 gallons * 155 MJ/gallon = 25000 MJ/year = 25 GJ/year. Increase that by about a third to include the amortization of the energy used to build the car and transport the fuel before sale, <a href="http://www.ilea.org/lcas/macleanlave1998.html">according to the Institute for Lifecycle Environmental Assessment</a> (summary of study by Maclean and Lave of Carnegie Mellon, 1988). That's 33 GJ/year.

Additionally, I live in a house that consumes an average of 100 therms of natural gas and 400 kWh of electricity per month year-round. The total for the house is (100 therms * 105 MJ/therm) + (400 kWh * 3.6 MJ/kWh) = 10500 + 1440 MJ = 11940 MJ/year. I share the house with my girlfriend, so count this as 6 GJ/year. My office is similar in size to our house, but we have 4 employees, so add another 3 GJ/year. The total is now 42 GJ/year.

I eat about 2500 kilocalories of food per day, and that reflects 7500 kilocalories of energy used, once farming and transportation energy costs are included. I probably do slightly better than that buying local produce and eating mostly vegetarian. (The 3:1 ratio is from <a href="http://www.jhsph.edu/clf/PDF%20Files/Sustainable_Ag_Horrigan.pdf">a 2002 paper by Leo Horrigan, et al.,</a> of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.) That's the same as 7500 kilocalories * ~4 kJ/kcal  = 30000 kJ = 30 MJ/day, which corresponds to 11 GJ/year. The total is 53 GJ/year. Virtually all of it comes from non-renewable resources (diesel, natural gas, and electricity from mostly coal).

This omits the amortized manufacture and transportation energy for the physical goods I buy--computers, books, furniture, clothes.

For reference, I've read of typical consumption rates for North America in the range of 200-300 GJ/year.
