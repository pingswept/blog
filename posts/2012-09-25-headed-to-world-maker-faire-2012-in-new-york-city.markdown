Wednesday night, I'm headed down to the [Open Hardware Summit][1] and [World Maker Faire][2] in New York City. If you're in the neighborhood on Saturday or Sunday, stop by the Rascal booth at Maker Faire. It will be in the Arduino Pavilion, which is in Zone C. I'll have a demo of the Rascal talking to multiple I<sup>2</sup>C devices from different web pages at the same time, and I'd be happy to answer any Rascal questions you've got.

I'll have some Rascals for sale with the new Beriberi release candidate on them, assuming that the wifi works well enough that I can charge credit cards at the event. You'll at least get the advantage of free shipping when I hand you your Rascal.
