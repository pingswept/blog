title: Allen and his Michael Jordan bag of tricks
---

When I was 13 or 14, I met a kid down the street who played basketball a lot. Most of the time, when my brother and I would ride by his house on our skateboards, he'd be out in his driveway trying to throw his basketball through the hoop. His name was Aaron, but we called him Allen because it annoyed him. Although he was not very good at basketball, he bragged about his innovative shots regularly. He'd demonstrate a new shot to us and then claim that it was the latest addition to his "Michael Jordan bag of tricks."

I recently emailed my brother to see if he remembered any details about what tricks exactly were kept in the MJBOT. He replied: "I do not recall which tricks Allen/Aaron kept in his bag. I believe they involved him dribbling around in a spastic fashion, then feebly hurling the ball at the rim, at which point the ball would clang off the rim and bounce into his bushes."
