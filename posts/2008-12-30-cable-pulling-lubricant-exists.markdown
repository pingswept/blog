title: Cable pulling lubricant exists
---

A few weeks ago, I was attempting to run Cat 6 UTP cable for gigabit Ethernet from our house to the garage in a pre-existing conduit. After a very frustrating attempt involving a fishtape, various strings, a flashlight, and lots of scrambling around in the crawlspace under the kitchen, I was convinced that it was not possible to pull the cable through all the corners in the crowded conduit without damaging the cable. My next thought was, "I need . . . cable . . . lubricant. I bet that exists." A quick trip to McMaster yielded 7431K41, a quart bottle of Ideal industries' Yellow 77 Plus cable pulling lubricant.

The next weekend, I re-pulled a new cable slathered in Yellow 77 Plus. The force required was reduced by an order of magnitude. I was gleeful.

Anyway, I just wanted to help distribute global knowledge a little more evenly: cable pulling lubricant exists! Also: gigabit Ethernet to the garage!
