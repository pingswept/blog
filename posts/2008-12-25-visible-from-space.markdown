title: Visible from space
---

I am excited to report a personal engineering milestone: something I had a hand in designing is visible from space. In the picture, the item of note is long, skinny, horizontal, and white.

I wasn't the lead designer, I didn't build the thing, and I can't say what it is, but the first iteration CAD model created of this thing was made by me.

I hope it is not interpreted by aliens as a message. "__" is not as friendly a welcome as I would like to give to our new overlords.
