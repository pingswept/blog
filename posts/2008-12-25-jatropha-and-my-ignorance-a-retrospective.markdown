title: 'Jatropha and my ignorance: a retrospective'

I don't know a damn thing about jatropha oil.

Some time ago, I heard that a friend of mine was starting a biofuels company that would import jatropha from Africa and turn it into biodiesel. At the time, I was skeptical of the plan. "Jatropha? What the hell is jatropha? Your feedstock is something I've never heard of-- how plentiful can that be?"

The next day, I was in the MIT library reading renewable energy journals, and I noticed <a href="http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/story?id=51917">an announcement</a> that a 15 MW combined heat and power plant run on jatropha oil was under development in Belgium.

It's a little late, but I wanted to let the internet know that I was wrong, and my dear friend Jesse was right. I don't know a damn thing about jatropha oil.
