title: There's a good burrito at Rengstorff and Middlefield
---

**La Costena, Los Altos Taqueria, and La Bamba**

These three burrito shops all do business at the same intersection in Mountain View, CA. Los Altos Taqueria is my default choice-- an excellent burrito and horchata for cheap, plus free chips and decent seating. La Costena has the best carne asada burrito I've ever eaten, but they're slightly more expensive, and your seating choices are either inside a convenience store or on a narrow walkway next to Rengstorff. On a warm day, you can sit on the grass at the dental plaza across the street. La Bamba is not a favorite of mine-- it's generally cold, the seats all face the wall, and the burritos are both slightly pricy and slightly spicy for my tastes.

**Ramon's El Burrito Real**

*Rengstorff Avenue, Mountain View, CA*

Employing some of the same fine burrito makers as La Costena (e.g. "Catarino"), Burrito Real is somehow not as tasty as La Costena. They do have a lot of seating though, so it's a good place on a rainy day with friends. It's too bad it doesn't rain very often in California, and I have so few friends.

**Mariachi's**

*Valencia between 16th and 17th in San Francisco, CA*

An excellent burrito. After they wrap up the good stuff in the tortilla, they put the burrito back on the grill.

**Gordo's**

A series of 7 outstanding taquerias around San Francisco and the East Bay.

**Andale Taqueria**

*University Avenue, Palo Alto, CA*

Expensive but crowded.

**The Treehouse**

*Stanford University, next to Palo Alto, CA*

Vile--do not visit. A Stanford tradition since 2000.

**Senor Taco**

*El Camino Real, Palo Alto, CA*

On the way to Fry's Electronics, but not that great. Not too pricey and yet not that crowded.

**High Tech Burrito**

*Solano Avenue, Berkeley, CA*

A decent burrito, if you don't mind feeling like a cog in a robot's intestinal system.

**Anna's Taqueria**

*Somerville Avenue, Cambridge, MA*

Anna's is a decent taqueria, even by California standards. I read in the MIT newspaper that Anna's is run by a relative of the family that runs Gordo's in the San Francisco area.

**Boca Grande**

My favorite taqueria in the greater Boston metropolitan area. Their carne asada is not particularly good, but the guacamole is outstanding. $5.51 for a great super burrito. I heard a rumor that Boca Grande was run by an estranged relative of the people who run Anna's.

**Tacos Lupita**

El Salvadorean burritos. Like Boca Grande, the carne asada is not that good, but the guacamole is great. Generally, I don't think the people at the counter understand my order, but they usually bring me something tasty anyway.

**Karlita's**

*Redwood City, CA*

A great burrito, but not open late. Karlita is the daughter of the family that runs the restaurant. I met her once.

**Del Taco**

*S. Euclid Avenue, Ontario, CA*

Strangely, this franchise is where my burrito addiction began.
