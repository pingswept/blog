---

Dave Slusher of Evil Genius Chronicles has a <a href="http://www.evilgeniuschronicles.org/cgi-bin/blosxom.cgi/2005/02/01#050201_01">podcast about his atheism</a>.

"Samson went out and had to slay 40,000 Philistines. That's a lot of people. That's a lot of slaying to do, particularly with just one bone. That's a hard day's work. God is omniscient, but he can't even create a world and a set of people that he doesn't need to smite, over, and over and over again."

"The governor can grant you clemency, but with God, somebody's got to die."
