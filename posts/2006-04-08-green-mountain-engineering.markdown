title: Green Mountain Engineering
---

Yesterday, I received an email from Eerik Hantsoo saying that Green Mountain Engineering is hiring. I had never heard of them before, even though I live just a few miles away. From their website, they sound like exactly the sort of company that I have been trying to find.

Then I thought that as soon as my friend mentions to them that I'm interested, they'll try to prefilter me using Google. (At least, that's what I would do.) They'll find this blog, and then they'll read this post.

So, welcome Green Mountain Engineering people. I'm prefiltering you as well, and so far, I'm impressed. I've been trying to find a job for a while now that involves hardcore engineering but is good for the world; that seems like what you do.

To save you the effort, I've precompiled and categorized some relevant Google results for you below.

**Some links of which I'm proud:**

[My trip to Tanzania to teach a class on embedded systems][1] to the Tanzania National Radiation Commission, sponsored by the International Atomic Energy Agency.

[A description of a presentation][2] I gave with a "playfully rebellious undertone" that won second place at BarCampNYC.

My [electric Porsche 914][3].

An [article that quotes me][4] in the Boston Globe.

An [article I wrote][5] about a solar oven that I built (pages 4 and 5 of the PDF).

**Mildly embarassing (and particularly low audio quality too)**

An [interview with Mike Goelzer and me][6] at BarcampNYC.

**Not me at all:**

Brandon Stafford, [the NASCAR "tire specialist."][7]

The [South African][8] Brandon Stafford.
