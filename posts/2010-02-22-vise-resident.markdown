My brother was kind enough to give me a woodworking vise for my birthday. In related news, my dad gave me a beefy old vise from his basement the next day (which was Christmas). As a result, there are now two heavy-duty vises residing in our basement.

The vise from my brother arrived first, so I mounted it up first. My dad brought the other vise over a few days later; with the arrival of some bolts from McMaster-Carr, I now have enough clamping force for three men.

Thanks, family!
