title: Am I in over my head?
---

Here is a conversation I had today, shortened for humorous effect:

"Are we using the new server yet?"

"We don't know."

"Well, I was thinking about installing some network monitoring software on it, you know, maybe make a map of the network."

"Oh, we have that. We have an inventory. It's part of our technology plan."

"Great! Is the technology plan on the server somewhere?"

"I don't know. . . . I have a paper copy."
