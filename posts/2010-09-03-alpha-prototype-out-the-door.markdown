I just sent the first working version of the Rascal to a friend of mine in California who has been helping with Rascal software development and debugging on the side. The hardware, which uses the second PCB revision, is not flawless, but it works well enough to download and boot Linux via TFTP and serve web pages.

It feels good to be shipping something to someone, even if he's not a paying customer.
