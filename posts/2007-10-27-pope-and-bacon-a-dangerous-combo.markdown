title: Pope and Bacon a dangerous combo
---

After meeting Ubuntu zealots <a href="http://popey.com">Alan Pope</a> and <a href="http://jonobacon.org">Jono Bacon</a> at <a href="http://fosscamp.org">Fosscamp</a> this morning, I made the mistake of leaving my laptop screen unlocked within the range of these two dangerous characters while I went to the bathroom. What's worse, I left a terminal window with a root prompt open on the desktop. (I don't remember why-- I think I was installing some software earlier.) When I got back, this so-called "Pope" had blown up the font size on my terminal window and added "rm -rf /" at the root prompt.

It was good for a laugh. Unfortunately, I didn't have the poise to take a screenshot.

Later, it was revealed that the Bacon, not Pope, was the instigator, or so says Pope.

Note for the non-haX0rs in the audience (I guess that's you, mom): "rm -rf /" is a command that recursively deletes all files in your filesystem. Incidentally, I did once execute that command on an OS X server that I was maintaining a few years ago. I needed to reinstall OS X for some reason, so I tried executing the legendary command. It was pretty sweet-- various programs on the desktop crashed, services disappeared, and the machine was eventually rendered unbootable.

Anyway, I won't make the mistake of leaving my laptop unprotected when Bacon is on this side of the Atlantic.

One other interesting note from Fosscamp-- I talked to Ubuntu Linux founder <a href="http://www.markshuttleworth.com/">Mark Shuttleworth</a> for a few minutes after one of the morning sessions; he mentioned that <a href="http://pingswept.org/2007/06/03/finally-booting-pre-installed-linux-on-an-oem-pc/">the Dell Linux machines that I was so excited about a few months ago</a> were actually Dell's idea. I had assumed that the whole <a href="http://www.dellideastorm.com/article/show/61771">Dell Ideastorm business</a> was more of a marketing exercise, while Dell and Canonical had actually been planning Dell PCs with Linux for a while. I guess I was wrong.
