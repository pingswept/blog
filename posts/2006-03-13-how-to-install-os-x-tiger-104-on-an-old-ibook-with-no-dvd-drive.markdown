title: How to install OS X Tiger 10.4 on an old iBook with no DVD drive
---

You need another Mac with a DVD drive. I'll call that the desktop, although it could be another iBook. Note that this is probably only worth doing if you've added 512 MB of RAM to your old iBook. Without extra RAM, Tiger runs painfully slowly.
<ol>
<li>Put the Tiger install DVD in the desktop. Restart it, and hold down the T key as it boots. Once you see a yellow firewire symbol on the screen, you can release the T key. You have just booted your desktop in what is called "target disk mode."</li>
<li>Connect the two machines with a firewire cable.</li>
<li>Reboot the old iBook with the option key held down. This will allow you to choose the boot disk.</li>
<li>It will take a while for the Tiger DVD to appear-- you'll see the iBook and desktop hard drives right away; the Tiger DVD will take a minute to show up.</li>
<li>Select the Tiger DVD, and click the arrow icon to continue.</li>
<li>Install Tiger as you would normally on a machine with a DVD drive.</li>
</ol>
