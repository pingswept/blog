We have survived our <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Battle_of_Bull_Run">First Battle of Bull Run</a> here at 57 Chandler. The anti-skunk battlements that we <a href="http://pingswept.org/2009/06/01/opening-salvo-in-the-great-skunk-war-of-2009/">installed</a> recently held up to an assault by a determined adversary. As can be seen in the picture below, a sapper has attempted to burrow through the wire mesh; the effort met with failure.
