s someone whose main passions in life (engineering, software) are incomprehensible to most people, I wish that my technically-minded friends would send Sharon Christmas gift ideas for me. Generally, they don't, but I figure you're in the same boat.

Here's what I'm recommending this year:

    * Energy meter from Blueline Innovations (NStar subsidizes these if you live in Massachusetts!)
    * Subscription to Cook's Illustrated: test-driven cooking, just like the engineers like it
    * Books by Aldren Watson or Eric Sloane
    * Books by Jon Muth (particularly good if you have kids)
    * Moving Heavy Things by Jan Adkins (good for kids and adults alike)
    * Carroll Smith's Nuts, Bolts, Fasteners and Plumbing Handbook: Yes, it's really a book about fasteners. (Matt already has this, unfortunately. I particularly recommend this for Steve, if he doesn't have it already.)
    * Type III parachute cord (I think a 1000 ft spool of this would be half of a great wedding gift.)
    * The quietest heat gun ever, the Master-Mite: http://www.masterappliance.com/masmite.html
    * The shop vac with the best noise/power ratio, the Fein Turbo II: http://www.feinus.com/p/newdustfree/New-955.htm
    * Springfield thermometer and hygrometer, but you can get them in Home Depot's garden section for $7

Ideas from 2007 still deemed worthy:

    * A memory card for his camera that uploads pictures to Flickr automatically through wireless: http://photojojo.com/store/awesomeness/eye-fi-wifi-memory/
    * A Fluke 179 voltmeter: http://www.amazon.com/Fluke-ESFP-True-Multimeter-Backlight/dp/B00012Z0V6/
    * Various items from thinkgeek.com, such as these straws: http://www.thinkgeek.com/geektoys/cubegoodies/9470/
