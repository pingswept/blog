Gas?
Electric? (4x the cost of gas, but more efficient?)
Oil?
Wood? (emissions)

First of all, your largest impact will likely be from investment in passive solar technologies, like thicker insulation or large, triple glazed windows, or an electronic thermostat, which allows you to turn down the heat automatically when you aren't around. We installed a programmable thermostat in our house for about $100 last fall; as a result, we saved around $500 this winter by not heating our house as much while we were at work.

On the second level, you have 4 choices for home heating: oil, electricity, natural gas, and wood.

I would reject oil on political grounds.

In Massachusetts, electricity is very expensive (about 4 times the price per unit of energy as compared to natural gas). I don't know where Northampton gets it's electricity, but as of 2003, less than 10% of US electricity was generated from renewable sources. Probably, you get it from a coal-burning power plant. Also, electricity is somewhat unreliable for home heating, as compared to natural gas or wood. You can get solar panels, but that will never work for heating-- you're better off letting the sun heat your house directly.

That leaves natural gas and wood. Myself, I would like to have a woodstove for when the hard times come, but most people regard wood as a pain in the ass-- dirty, involves carrying logs around and the like. You might look into pellet stoves, which burn compressed sawdust pellets that look like rabbit food-- very even, hot heat without the hassle of logs. It's questionable as to whether wood heating is ecologically responsible. In New England, it's sustainable at some population density; in cities, it definitely is not.

A few days ago, the EPA released <a href="http://www.epa.gov/Compliance/resources/publications/monitoring/caa/woodstoves/certifiedwood.pdf">their 2008 evaluation of wood stoves</a>. From an environmental perspective, Vermont Castings' stoves won by a long shot. They have multiple stoves that produce less than 1 g/h of particulates under EPA Method 5G or 5H. Virtually all of their competitors are worse by a factor of 2-4. The only exception are pellet stoves.

Relative to other wood-burning systems, for the energy released, pellet stoves win on emissions by a factor of about 3 (0.13 g/MJ vs. 0.45-0.50 g/MJ for a modern stove), according to <a href="http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/ap42/ch01/related/woodstove.pdf">a somewhat dated (December 1998) but interesting report prepared for the EPA by Omni Environmental Services</a>.

So, the remaining choice, which is probably the best, is what's called a direct vent natural gas furnace, sometimes also called a condensing furnace. They have a secondary heat exchange that gets enough heat out of the exhaust that you can vent it through a PVC pipe, rather than a metal one. You get efficiencies of greater than 90% and relatively low carbon dioxide emissions as compared to oil, because you are burning mostly methane (CH4), rather than long chains of carbon found in heating oil. You can see actual numbers here (scroll to Table 1): http://www.hydroquebec.com/sustainable-development/environnement/pdf/ges_chauffage.pdf  

You might also look at a cogenerating furnace, which produces electricity and heat from natural gas. Electricity generation is generally inefficient, but if you need heat anyway, it's great. I saw one of these at the MIT Energy conference this weekend: http://www.climate-energy.com/products.asp

You want the floor temperature to stay below 85 F (303 K), <a href="http://www.thisoldhouse.com/toh/article/0,,20163505-2,00.html">according to Richard Trethewey of This Old House</a>.

Emissivity of wood is around 0.85.
0.85 * 303^4 * 5.67 * 10^-8 = 406 W/m^2.
