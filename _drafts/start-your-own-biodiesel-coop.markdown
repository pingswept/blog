A friend of mine down in Providence, Rhode Island, is thinking about starting a biodiesel cooperative. At first, this would probably consist of him buying a 600 L (150 gallon) tank and getting periodic deliveries of 100 gallons of biodiesel from <a href="http://www.newportbiodiesel.com/cms/index.php?option=com_frontpage&Itemid=35">Newport Biodiesel</a> that refines the stuff from waste vegetable oil they buy for $0.50/gallon.

Restaurants average 50 gallons/mo of WVO.

It takes around 8 pounds of WVO to make a gallon of biodiesel.
