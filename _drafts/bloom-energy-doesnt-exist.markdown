title: Bloom Energy doesn't exist
---
At work, I build machines for renewable energy companies and write feasibility assessments for government agencies and private investors. When a new energy company has a flashy enough launch that normal people (especially around Boston) hear about it, I get a bunch of emails asking whether it's for real this time. The latest of these companies is Bloom Energy. (Other notable entrants are GreenFuel, Nanosolar, Konarka, FloDesign, and Sun Catalytix.)

On the solar car team that I worked on in college, we had a similar situation-- there were lots enthusiastic undergrads each year who wanted to make improvements to the car. They had some of what was needed, like good ideas and enthusiasm, but they often didn't understand the implications of what they were planning. Sure, it would be great to add a liquid cooling system to the battery pack, but it's not worth the weight. Yes, it would be neat to put the suspension inside the wheels, but bearing friction losses would be tripled. Yes, we'd like to have a holographic concentrator over the solar array, but the race is in 3 weeks, and we don't have the motor attached yet.

Some of them would eventually come around and realize that they had to refine their ideas before they would work, but most of them just gave up. Eventually, we developed a colloquial way of describing the folks who came in with great fanfare, but who would probably never make any actual contribution to building the car: "Oh, the guy who wanted to make the car amphibious? That guy doesn't exist." It was a little rude, but it makes the crucial distinction needed for engineering efforts: in the long run, will it actually work? If you're not going to deliver something that makes the car drive faster when the race starts, you do not exist in my world.

In that way, Bloom Energy doesn't exist. They have a promising technology: a solid oxide fuel cell to generate electricity from gaseous fuel with some kind of heat recovery included, all packaged in a shipping container. They're testing it out with real customers. They have investors who will pay them to keep trying for a while yet. But those are only the first steps of the long journey to replacing our current energy infrastructure.

Unfortunately, there are plenty of energy companies that have long since met the thresholds that Bloom is blowing horns about. The problem is that Bloom trumpets their strengths and doesn't mention the areas where they fall down. When the weaknesses fit in some patterns, we detect them immediately.

Take, for example, my new (fictional) company, Double Solar. We start with conventional solar cells, which we already know have a lifetime of at least 25 years and can be made in an environmentally friendly way. The only problem is that their efficiency is too low. However, with our new, proprietary DoubleCell technology, we double the efficiency of every cell. What we do is gather all the cells together before they are assembled into a module. For each cell, we buy another cell of the same efficiency (again, remember, we are using conventional solar cells, so we can source these cells from multiple suppliers). We take the pair of cells and put them next to each other. Then, we use module assembly best practices to make modules out of them. Double the efficiency with the same reliability and lifetime of conventional silicon solar!

"Wait, you just put another cell next to each cell? That's ridiculous." Right.

But when the thresholds are more obscure, we turn off our skepticism. We see Katie Couric, or whoever it is, telling us that this green energy thing works for Google, and researchers say it might work for everyone real soon.

The thresholds that energy companies usually fail on are cost and lifetime.

Algae biofuel companies like Greenfuel are a great example of the cost failure. From a system level, Greenfuel sounds brilliant-- you pump CO<sub>2</sub> and sunlight into a greenhouse to grow algae, which you then refine into biofuels. It sounds great. The core problem is that liquid fuels (like diesel and gasoline) are around the price of bottled water. With the money you get from the biofuel, you can't afford the greenhouse, piping, cooling, and mixing required to grow the algae.

Thin film CIGS companies like Nanosolar are good candidates for failing on lifetime. For example, I usually think of a plastic bag as waterproof, as long as it doesn't have any rips in it. At the IEEE solar conference last summer, I heard someone from a CIGS company (maybe Solopower?) mention in a presentation that if they merely enclosed their cells in plastic, rather than glass, their efficiency would be cut in half within 7 hours. With glass, they hoped to extend this to 25 YEARS!
