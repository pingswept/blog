I call it Field Athletics Hard Times, or FAHT. This means that you can s
ay, "Have you been FAHTing in the basement? It smells terrible down there." (In Boston, that's funny.)

The first good example I've come up with involves the woodstove we had installed recently. ([Barry John Chimney][6] did a great job, by the way.) We can buy a cord of wood for around $250, but I can also collect
pallets from around Somerville pretty easily as well. Before I can burn the pallets, I have to cut them up
. The fastest combination I've found is using a circular saw with the blade set to cut just shy of the ful
l depth of the cross planks, for if you cut all the way through, the planks sag and bind the blade. Once t
he planks are 95% cut, you can stomp on them, and then cut up the remaining stringers wih a handsaw. Betwe
en the two types of sawing, the stomping, and the lugging of pallets, it's a fair bit of work. Running the
 woodstove saves us something like $0.50 per hour on gas heating costs,
