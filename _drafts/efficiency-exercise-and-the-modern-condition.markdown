One of colleagues was kind enough to bequeath me a vintage reel mower. It weighs 48 pounds and was manufactured shortly after 1918, as dated by the patent on the handle, which I believe refers to <a href="http://www.google.com/patents?id=KO5WAAAAEBAJ">this patent</a>. It's very similar, but not quite identical, to <a href="http://mammascottage.com/Photos/20/20a.jpg">this mower</a>.

A modern reel mower of similar dimensions, like the <a href="http://brill.de/produkte.php?produktgruppe=6&language=EN">Brill Razorcut</a>, weighs around half as much. While I haven't  actually used one, I imagine that it is substantially easier to push than my lovely behemoth.

This brings us to the question of what I'm really trying to accomplish by mowing the lawn.

I want the grass to be uniformly short across the extents of the lawn. I want to avoid loud machinery, burning petrochemicals, and smelling like gas. I definitely want to avoid cutting my feet or otherwise hurting myself.
