Disruptive thermoelectric generator can be wrapped as a sheet around a hot pipe to make electricity. Waste heat recovery.
Better efficiency
Can work with lower temperature
Can scale up mechanically.
Still very early stage-- developing proof of concept.
Break even in year 3. $79M in sales by year 5. Aiming to be acquired. Estimated ROI 14x.

Dave Sudolsky, President of Anellotech-- petrochemicals from biomass. Benzene, toluene and xylene from biomass. These are 3 of the 7 primary petrochemicals in the world. Fluidized bed reactor developed at UMass Amherst. Residence time is 2-10 s and occurs at atmospheric pressure. Claimed residence times of 5-10 days for cellulosic ethanol.
George Huber, Founder and Chair of SAB

xylene -> chemical plants -> plastics
toluene and benzene -> oil and gas refineries -> fuels

They think they can hit 100 cents/gallon. They want to build the first production facilities. In the long term, they want to license their technology. Registered anellotech.com in June 2008; just switched to Dreamhost November 5th.

David Berman, AgriPower. electricity and heat cogeneration from biomass. Lumber mills, municipal water, diaper manufacturers. On-site burning of pallets for heat and electricity. Super heats materials to 2000 degrees. The Power Island The scale of the machine was not clear. Berman quoted a rating of "300 kW/hr", but that doesn't make sense to me. Profit-sharing model-- we give you the machine for free that will reduce your power costs. They take 1/3 to 1/2 of the money that you will save on heat and electricity.
Already spent $5M. Looking for $10M to execute their plan.

Jim Mahoney, CEO of Novomer. Core competency is catalysis. Create aliphatic polycarbonates for eco-friendly packaging material. Already beta testing adhesives. and CO based small molecules for use as chemical intermediates. Out of Cornell, just moved corporate headquarters to Boston.
Already have $6.6M Series A, plus government grants for $1.0M.

Paul Fenton, Aardwolf Controls. Other guy is Frank Harrington. Make inverters for PV. Fenton claimed that most inverter technology has been around for 25 years. Expect inverter cost to rise in 2 years. 

Frank Harrington
Not a micro-inverter. Not an AC module. Hybrid architecture. Microinverter is one small inverter per panel. Aardwolf has a small device on each panel, but an external command module. Web-based monitoring system.

Showed a picture of a 200 W prototype with very low component count. Most inverter warranties are 10-15 years. Aardwolf is offering a 25 year warranty.
