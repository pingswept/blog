title: GPLv3 conference coverage for Wikinews
---
Any BarCamp folks going to the <a href="http://gplv3.fsf.org/process-definition">GPLv3</a> launch <a href="http://web.mit.edu/conferences/www/software/sf_info.html">conference at MIT on Monday</a>? I'm planning on covering it for Wikinews, and I could use some help.
