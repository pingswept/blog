Some data about driving to Islesboro, Maine, from Cambridge, Massachusetts:

The lady friend made it in 3h 43m.

After 1:10, you should be crossing the Piscataqua River into Maine in Portsmouth, New Hampshire.

Just south of Portland, Maine, you choose between the Maine Turnpike, also known as 95 (or 495 on pre-2005 maps), and 295 (known as 95 on pre-2005 maps).

On the Maine Turnpike, get off at exit 102 for Gardiner. Head east on 9/126. Turn left at the first stoplight just as you enter Gardiner. You are still on 126.
