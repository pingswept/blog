## Crossword puzzles ##

I've made a few crossword puzzles. I've come up with the theme entries using paper and pencil; for the fill I used lots of suggestions from [Crosserville](https://www.crosserville.com/) (a website that gives you a list of words that fit whatever pattern of letters you're trying to match and also draws out the grid and formats the clues nicely).

Many of them have clues that only my kids know; that's to even the playing field a little bit.

The two earliest puzzles have some pretty dicey clues. I was just trying to finish the puzzle any way I could. By the third one, I think the puzzle is at least respectable, though still aimed at a local audience.
