Tesla batteries

The battery modules from the Model S are 24 V, 5.2 kWh capacity.

If I can't get the Tesla BMS to work, there is a replacement available. [Overkill Solar's second generation replacement BMS ](https://overkillsolar.com/2024/08/20/pathfinder-bms-prototypes/), called Pathfinder, may soon be available. The Pathfinder seems to replace the Tesla BMS. It seems that each BMS can handle 3-16 cells. This seems insnae, since each module has 6 x 74 = 444 cells.

Another alternative is the [Vero BMS v2](https://veroelectric.com/product/vero-bms-v2). From what I can tell, the Vero BMS plugs into daisy-chained Tesla BMS modules.
