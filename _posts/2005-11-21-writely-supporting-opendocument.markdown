Writely <a href="http://www.writely.com/View.aspx?docid=afmc9ph7txv2">announced today</a> that has added support for ODF. Writely is an AJAX word processor, i.e. a program like Microsoft Word that you use through your web browser.
That means that there are now several different programs supporting ODF:
<ul>
<li>OpenOffice / StarOffice</li>
<li>KOffice</li>
<li>Writely</li>
</ul>
Abiword and Textmaker can open ODF, and they're both working on saving in the format.
