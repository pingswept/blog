	Here is a conversation I had today, shortened for humorous effect:
	&#8220;Are we using the new server yet?&#8221;
	&#8220;We don&#8217;t know.&#8221;
	&#8220;Well, I was thinking about installing some network monitoring software on it, you know, maybe make a map of the network.&#8221;
	&#8220;Oh, we have that. We have an inventory. It&#8217;s part of our technology plan.&#8221;
	&#8220;Great! Is the technology plan on the server somewhere?&#8221;
	&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. . . . I have a paper copy.&#8221;
