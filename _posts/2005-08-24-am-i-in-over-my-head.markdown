Here is a conversation I had today, shortened for humorous effect:
"Are we using the new server yet?"
"We don't know."
"Well, I was thinking about installing some network monitoring software on it, you know, maybe make a map of the network."
"Oh, we have that. We have an inventory. It's part of our technology plan."
"Great! Is the technology plan on the server somewhere?"
"I don't know. . . . I have a paper copy."
