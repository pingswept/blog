title: Why hasn't Brandon been blogging recently?

This blog has tended toward dormancy over the last year because I've been pouring all my energy into a new project, [the Rascal][1]. It's a small computer aimed at artists and scientists who want to add web interfaces to their projects. It similar to the [Arduino][2], but much more powerful.

Recently, I've been alternating between working on the Rascal and various renewable energy engineering projects with Matt Dorson at [Mystic River Engineering][3]. In April, the first batch of Rascal beta units arrived from an assembler in China; I've sold 4 of them to various adventurous friends of mine for hardware testing. In the immediate future (May, June), I'm working on a project at MIT with Matt, but on the side, I'm selling more Rascals and gathering results from hardware testing. Depending on the results of the tests, I'll either commit to a larger batch of 100 Rascals, or run another small batch with improved hardware.

If you're interested in the Rascal, you should follow the Rascal on Twitter [here][4], or add your email address to the announcement list on the [main page of the Rascal website][5]. There's also a quick [video interview][6] of me explaining how the Rascal works. It was shot by [Chris Connors][7] at the 2011 mini-Maker Faire in Cambridge, MA, USA.
