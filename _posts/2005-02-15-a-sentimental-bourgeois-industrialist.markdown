	Despite having experienced a rather harried passage on the sinuous roadways, filled as they were with every manner of conveyance, of the west Boston suburbs, it is the charge of this witness to set forth and certify with great sincerity his successful arrival, unharmed and with no licenses taken against his body of rights and liberties, at the industrial environs which serve as the illuminated backdrop to his daily efforts in the venue of commerce. Not without misgivings of the most sentimental sort to this responsibility do I arise, but having done so, and having compared in my mind my current surroundings and effects, both personal and impersonal, with the noumenal realm in which I dwelled over the period of delicate slumber allowed to every gentleman once his duties with regard to society and his fellows are discharged in full for the day, I can state without reservation that the satisfactions evident  in my present condition seem most scarce, considered in the purview of our modern industrial system.
