title: Not so fast, you jackbooted thugs

Hello wiretappers. If you are listening, could you please point out to Mr. Bush and the Justice Department that while my general intent with much of this blog is to annoy people (recently, Robert Kuttner, Alan Yates, et al.) through the internet, I am not doing so anonymously.

It seems that Mr. Bush has signed into law <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c109:H.R.3402:">H.R. 3402</a>, which has a section 113 that adds this phrase:
<blockquote>(C) in the case of subparagraph (C) of subsection (a)(1), includes any device or software that can be used to originate telecommunications or other types of communications that are transmitted, in whole or in part, by the Internet (as such term is defined in section 1104 of the Internet Tax Freedom Act (47 U.S.C. 151 note)).</blockquote>
to <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode47/usc_sec_47_00000223----000-.html">US Code Title 47, Section 223</a>. The act now criminalizes one who:
<blockquote><span class="ptext-3">makes a telephone call or utilizes a telecommunications device, whether or not conversation or communication ensues, without disclosing his identity and with intent to annoy, abuse, threaten, or harass any person at the called number or who receives the communications [through the internet, by language above].
</span></blockquote>
Unfortunately, this is what I do when I get off work. So, you heard it here first-- yes, I am trying to annoy you, but don't worry, my identity is disclosed on the About page. No need to haul me off to the gulag just yet.
