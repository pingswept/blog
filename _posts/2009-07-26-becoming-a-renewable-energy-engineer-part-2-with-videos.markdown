title: Becoming a renewable energy engineer, part 2 (with videos)
categories: energy, engineering
---
I was invited to speak at Olin College a few months back as part of a seminar series about sustainability and engineering. The talk was indirectly inspired by <a href="http://pingswept.org/2008/12/29/becoming-a-renewable-energy-engineer/">my previous post</a> on the topic. (By the way, <a href="http://www.olin.edu/">Olin</a> is great. If I were going to engineering school now, I'd definitely apply to Olin.) The folks at Olin recorded the talk, and after some manipulations with <a href="http://mpgtx.sourceforge.net/">mpgtx</a>, it's now up on Youtube.

The video is posted in 6 parts below. If I had to summarize in a few lines what I said, I'd say:

<ul>
<li>Most importantly: answer the right question.</li>
<li>If the question is, "How can I use our current energy infrastructure to propel myself in a 4000 pound steel cage?" the right answer is, "Build a hybrid SUV."</li>
<li>If the question is, "How can I kill more efficiently?" the right answer is, "Make robots kill on my behalf."</li>
<li>These are the wrong questions. Right now, the crucial questions we need to answer involve balancing our desire for the fruits of energy consumption against global heat death.</li>
<li>Differential equations: learn to solve them by computer. Learn when to distrust that computer.</li>
<li>Take statistics.</li>
<li>If a class is boring, it's because it's taught poorly. There are no college classes in boring subjects.</li>
<li>Go broad first. Going deep is fine if you have the passion, but as an investment, it's unlikely to pay off.</li>
</ul>

Thanks to Matt Ritter, Elsa, and the rest of the Olin folks who helped with the video taping and mucking around with the video files.
