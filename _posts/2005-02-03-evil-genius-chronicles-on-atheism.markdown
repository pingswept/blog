---
Dave Slusher of Evil Genius Chronicles has a <a href="http://www.evilgeniuschronicles.org/cgi-bin/blosxom.cgi/2005/02/01#050201_01">podcast about his atheism</a>.

&#8220;Samson went out and had to slay 40,000 Philistines. That&#8217;s a lot of people. That&#8217;s a lot of slaying to do, particularly with just one bone. That&#8217;s a hard day&#8217;s work. God is omniscient, but he can&#8217;t even create a world and a set of people that he doesn&#8217;t need to smite, over, and over and over again.&#8221;

&#8220;The governor can grant you clemency, but with God, somebody&#8217;s got to die.&#8221;
