I returned from <a href="http://barcamp.org/index.cgi?BarCampNYC">BarCamp</a> in New York last night. Overall, it was more fun than educational, but that's only because it was so fun.

Some geeks in Palo Alto started BarCamp last summer as a response to O'Reilly's invite-only Foo Camp. Then came BarCamp in Amsterdam, and then BarCamp in New York. About 70 people showed up for 36 hours of geeking out in the 9th floor office of a t-shirt company. I only knew three of the people there, though as a bonus, Noah T. Winer (yes, THE Noah T. Winer) showed up on Saturday night unannounced. In general, it was very refreshing to be able to make ridiculously technical jokes and still get a few laughs.

Mike Goelzer and I presented <a href="http://pingswept.org/wikr">our idea for making the entire web as unreliable as Wikipedia</a>. It went over reasonably well.

There are a lot of pictures from the event on Flickr under the tag BarCamp or BarCampNYC. In most of the pictures that include me, I <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jcn/86766122/">look like an idiot</a>, but there are a couple where I look <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jcn/86685618/">relatively normal</a>.

Points that I want to make without taking the time to embed in standard prose:

1. It was fun to see stuff about us pop up on Flickr, people's blogs, and other websites throughout the weekend.

2. It's interesting to meet people whose blogs/websites I've read before (notably Chris Messina, Tara Hunt, and Jesse Chan-Norris).

3. New York was depressing. I'd been avoiding going there for 33 years, and it doesn't appear that I was missing much. Not going to San Francisco-- that would be missing something. I realize that experiencing New York from the 9th floor of an office building is ridiculous, but at least I can rule out the possibility that it's Nirvana.

Many thanks to Amit Gupta, Mike Goelzer, Nick Gray and everyone else who helped organize the event. You're all invited to BarCampBoston some day, unless I move to Kuujjuaq, Nunavik.
