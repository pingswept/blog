title: Wind turbine costs
---
I've been arguing with <a href="http://fiveislandsorchard.wordpress.com">my associate Ben</a> about the relative costs of wind turbines. (We work at a <a href="http://www.greenmountainengineering.com">GreenMountain, a renewable energy engineering firm near Boston</a>, so this is what we do for fun.) We're both puzzled over the continued growth in the size of wind turbines.

Aldo da Rosa writes in <em>Fundamentals of Renewable Energy Processes, Elsevier Academic Press, 2005</em> (pp. 599-600):
<blockquote>"For a given wind regimen, the amount of energy that can be abstracted from the wind is proportional to the swept area of the turbine. . . . The mass of the plant (in a first-order scaling) varies with the cube of the diameter. . . . Hence for the same amount of energy produced, the total equipment mass varies inversely with the diameter. Since costs tend to grow with mass, many small turbines ought to be more economical than one large one."</blockquote>
This is exactly the argument that Ben came up with last week. The flaw, as best as I can tell, appears to be that cost does not actually track mass. Historically, it appears that costs are dropping as mass increases.

The data above comes from Gil Masters' <em>Renewable and Efficient Electric Power Systems, Wiley-Interscience, 2004</em> p. 372, with the 1981 data point added from an American Wind Energy Association paper, <em>"The Economics of Wind Energy."</em> Masters states that, "taller towers increase energy faster than costs increase," (p. 372), but he does not directly address mass scaling relative to area scaling. Masters also cites data from the Canadian Ministry of Natural Resources that estimates the annual operating and maintenance costs (~$2m) of a 60 MW windfarm at 3% of the capital costs (~$60m).

Let me add here (because I can hear <a href="http://keith.has.no.blog.com">fellow wind energy enthusiast Keith</a> gnashing his teeth over TCP/IP) that if I had the data, I would prefer to see wind turbine values expressed as $/(kWh/year), rather than $/kW, where the kW rating calculated can be achieved at some high windspeed found only in Stillwater, Minnesota.
