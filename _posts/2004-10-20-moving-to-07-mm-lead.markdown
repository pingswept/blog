title: Moving to 0.7 mm lead
---
My first great pencil was the classic PD105T "Techniclick," which I used from 1999 until 2002. Two years ago, after a brief investigation of the PD235T "Techniclick II," I migrated away from the Techniclick platform entirely. The Techniclick has a small plastic cap that covers the eraser, which necessitates removal of the cap whenever erasing is required. (Admittedly, the Techniclick is a consumer-grade pencil, aimed more at college students than providers of professional services.) Though I can't say that the aesthetics of my replacement, the QE515 "TwistErase III," match those of the Techniclicks, the superior erasing system of the TwistErase won me over.

Since arriving at my current workplace, I've been using the standard PD345 "Quicker Clicker," or the translucent PD345T, when available. These are a fine pencil for the money, though the erasing system is particularly substandard-- a cap AND an eraser that can be removed inadvertently.

As the careful reader will have noted from the part numbers, up until now, I've been using strictly 0.5 mm leaded pencils. Today, I experimented with the PD347T, and the results were encouraging. The 0.7 mm lead doesn't seem to develop the same sharp edge endemic to the 0.5 mm ecosystem, which can result in paper tear. I'm not sure how the 347 will fare in the long run, but initial results are promising.

I have also been considering experimenting with Pentel's "Caplet" series. As the Babelfished copy at <a href="http://www.pentel.it/produtti/portamine.htm">Pentel's Italian website</a> says, it "does not pierce the pockets." Certainly an annoyance I've suffered, but I don't know that keeping track of the cap would be worth it to me.
