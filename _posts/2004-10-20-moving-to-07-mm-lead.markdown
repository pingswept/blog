	My first great pencil was the classic PD105T &#8220;Techniclick,&#8221; which I used from 1999 until 2002. Two years ago, after a brief investigation of the PD235T &#8220;Techniclick II,&#8221; I migrated away from the Techniclick platform entirely. The Techniclick has a small plastic cap that covers the eraser, which necessitates removal of the cap whenever erasing is required. (Admittedly, the Techniclick is a consumer-grade pencil, aimed more at college students than providers of professional services.) Though I can&#8217;t say that the aesthetics of my replacement, the QE515 &#8220;TwistErase III,&#8221; match those of the Techniclicks, the superior erasing system of the TwistErase won me over.
	Since arriving at my current workplace, I&#8217;ve been using the standard PD345 &#8220;Quicker Clicker,&#8221; or the translucent PD345T, when available. These are a fine pencil for the money, though the erasing system is particularly substandard&#8211; a cap AND an eraser that can be removed inadvertently.
	As the careful reader will have noted from the part numbers, up until now, I&#8217;ve been using strictly 0.5 mm leaded pencils. Today, I experimented with the PD347T, and the results were encouraging. The 0.7 mm lead doesn&#8217;t seem to develop the same sharp edge endemic to the 0.5 mm ecosystem, which can result in paper tear. I&#8217;m not sure how the 347 will fare in the long run, but initial results are promising.
	I have also been considering experimenting with Pentel&#8217;s &#8220;Caplet&#8221; series. As the Babelfished copy at <a href="http://www.pentel.it/produtti/portamine.htm">Pentel&#8217;s Italian website</a> says, it &#8220;does not pierce the pockets.&#8221; Certainly an annoyance I&#8217;ve suffered, but I don&#8217;t know that keeping track of the cap would be worth it to me.
