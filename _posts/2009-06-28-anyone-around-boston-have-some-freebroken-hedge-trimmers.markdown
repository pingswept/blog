Greetings, fellow internet denizen! I am concocting a device that I call The Electric Lawn Mower That Doesn't Suck.

I have an electric lawn mower that is large, heavy, almost as loud as a gas mower, and only works with a cord attached. I also have a reel mower that is pretty sweet, but it can't cut grass taller than approximately the radius of the blade cylinder, so it leaves stragglers.

I think if I could mount a hedge trimmer on something like a reel mower and power it off a cordless drill battery, I'd be golden. Hedge trimmers are pretty loud, but I think I could rework the drive mechanism so that it was quiet (though it would cost a bit more).

To this end, if you have a crappy <a href="http://bit.ly/hedge">hedge trimmer</a> that you would be willing to surrender to my prototyping efforts, I would be happy to take it off your hands.
