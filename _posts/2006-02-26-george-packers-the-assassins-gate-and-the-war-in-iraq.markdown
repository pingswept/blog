I've just been reading a <a href="http://www.fsgbooks.com/fsg/1739034.htm">book by George Packer about the war in Iraq</a> called "The Assassins' Gate." This is a terrible name for the book, but after the first three chapters, which are dry but important background, the book is quite good. The penultimate chapter is one of the best descriptions of the war that I've read. One paragraph particularly struck me:
<blockquote>In the media, Iraq generated words as bitter as any event in modern American history. But most Americans didn't turn against other citizens, any more than they joined together in a common cause. Iraq was a strangely distant war. It was always hard to picture the place; the war didn't enter the popular imagination in songs that everyone soon knew by heart, in the manner of previous wars. The one slender American novel that the war has inspired so far, "Checkpoint," by Nicholson Baker—a dialogue over lunch in a Washington hotel room between two old friends, one of whom is preparing to assassinate President Bush—has nothing to do with Iraq and everything to do with the ugliness of politics in this country. Michael Moore, the left's answer to Rush Limbaugh, made a hugely successful movie, "Fahrenheit 9/11," in which Saddam's Iraq was portrayed in a crudely fantastical light—a happy place where children flew kites. Iraq provided a blank screen onto which Americans projected anything they wanted, in part because so few Americans had anything directly at stake there. The war's proponents and detractors spoke of the conflict largely in theoretical terms: imperialism, democracy, unilateralism, weapons of mass destruction, preëmption, terrorism, totalitarianism, neoconservatism, appeasement. The exceptions were the soldiers and their families, who carried almost the entire weight of the war.</blockquote>
I was both excited and slightly disappointed to learn that the chapter <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/fact%3CWBR%3E/content/articles/050704fa%3CWBR%3E_fact3">originally appeared in the New Yorker</a> last summer.

I think that the core of the problem is described very well by the sentence, "Iraq provided a blank screen onto which Americans projected anything they wanted, in part because so few Americans had anything directly at stake there."

I think that's why the US is so divided over the war-- we mostly don't know what is happening there, so we pull together scraps that support our instincts.

What a mess.
