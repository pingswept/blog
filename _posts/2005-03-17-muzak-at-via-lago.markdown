I noticed these knobs on the wall at Via Lago, an expensive sandwich shop in downtown Lexington. When I turned the knob on the right, the background music near the backdoor got louder. I didn't realize that you could buy an integrated Muzak system-- I thought you just got CDs in the mail or a secret radio broadcast or something.
