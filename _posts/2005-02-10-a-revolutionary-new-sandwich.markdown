title: A revolutionary new sandwich
---
I&#8217;ll be the first to admit that the doughnut is a fine food. It tastes sweet, it is inexpensive, and it is available throughout the Commonwealth and beyond.

However,  sometimes the doughnut is a little light. While certainly a power-packing treat, the doughnut may require assistance to qualify as a meal. For this reason, I have been recommending the doughnut sandwich (since January, 2005). The doughnut sandwich consists of a fine doughnut, flanked above and below by bread.

You will think to yourself, how the devil will I get a round piece of bread that neatly matches my doughnut? This is where <a href="http://www.thismodernworld.com/">this modern world</a>&#8217;s other leavened torus &#8212; the bagel &#8212; comes into play.

Slice a bagel in half and slip a fine doughnut in between. You are now holding a doughnut sandwich.
