	Recently, I bought a Sharp Actius MP30 laptop and installed Linux on it. I installed the default Ubuntu &#8220;Hoary Hedgehog&#8221; preview release. As far as I can tell, everything except the wireless card works out of the box, though I did have to add i8042.nomux as a kernel option in grub to get the trackpad to work, as <a href="http://www.cameltail.com/projects/sharp/">suggested by some guy named Carl at Cameltail</a>. He&#8217;s managed to get the wireless working under Slackware, but I haven&#8217;t yet.
