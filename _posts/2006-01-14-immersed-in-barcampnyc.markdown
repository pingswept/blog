I flew down to New York this morning for BarCampNYC. We're all in the offices of a T-shirt company on the 9th floor of an office building on Broadway. As of 3:10 pm, there are 55 registrants, we've consumed roughly $300 of pizza, and we're almost out of nametags. I don't think I've seen so many weird laptop-carrying zealots in one place.

There are four presentation areas: Conference, Kitchen, Dev Room, and /etc. The latter was added as an afterthought this morning as the first three rooms were filling up. The list of presentations is also <a href="http://barcamp.org/index.cgi?NYCPresentationTracks">on the wiki</a>.

This morning, I saw a presentation by Duncan Werner about thumbstacks.com, a website he developed that is an AJAX version of Powerpoint. It allows you to create and share presentations on the web. Near the end of his presentation, someone asked him how many hours he had spent writing it; he replied with something like, "Longer than I should have-- I started it on the 30th, so almost two weeks, working half time." For what he demonstrated, I am impressed that he could pull it off in 7 days of work.
