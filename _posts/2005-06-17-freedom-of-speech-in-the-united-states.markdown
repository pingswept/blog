	I am fortunate in that I live a comfortable life in the United States, where I have heard that we have a government that protects &#8220;freedom of speech.&#8221; As a test, I thought I&#8217;d quickly summarize what I think about my government.
	1. I do not &#8220;support our troops.&#8221; I do not honor people who are trained to use violence to solve problems, regardless of whether their intent is to promote freedom around the globe or not.
	2. I think my president, George W. Bush, is mentally ill. My understanding is that he believes that a nonhuman being (&#8221;God&#8221;) speaks to him, often at night.
	We&#8217;ll see whether jackbooted thugs come and arrest me tonight.
