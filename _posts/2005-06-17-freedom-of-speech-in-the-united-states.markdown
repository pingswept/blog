title: Freedom of speech in the United States
---
I am fortunate in that I live a comfortable life in the United States, where I have heard that we have a government that protects "freedom of speech." As a test, I thought I'd quickly summarize what I think about my government.
1. I do not "support our troops." I do not honor people who are trained to use violence to solve problems, regardless of whether their intent is to promote freedom around the globe or not.
2. I think my president, George W. Bush, is mentally ill. My understanding is that he believes that a nonhuman being ("God") speaks to him, often at night.
We'll see whether jackbooted thugs come and arrest me tonight.
