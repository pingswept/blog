I don't understand why RSS aggregators don't suck. I've tried lots of different RSS aggregators over the past two years or so, and as far as I can tell, the basic effect is to take all the news websites and blogs that I visit, strip out the graphical elements, and cram them into a paned interface reminiscent of Outlook. Why is this better than tabs with the sites open in them?
