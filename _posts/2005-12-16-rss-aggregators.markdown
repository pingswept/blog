	I don&#8217;t understand why RSS aggregators don&#8217;t suck. I&#8217;ve tried lots of different RSS aggregators over the past two years or so, and as far as I can tell, the basic effect is to take all the news websites and blogs that I visit, strip out the graphical elements, and cram them into a paned interface reminiscent of Outlook. Why is this better than tabs with the sites open in them?
