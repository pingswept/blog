	After bungling around with wireless drivers, the wireless-tools package,<br />
and Google for a few weeks, I had an interesting thought. I knew that a<br />
guy named Carl in California had gotten his wireless working pretty<br />
easily using Slackware, which I had tried earlier with the same error<br />
symptoms as with Ubuntu. In all cases, it sounded like everything was<br />
working correctly, but that my wireless card&#8217;s radio was turned off.  At<br />
one point, someone suggested that the screen brightness switch, labeled<br />
&#8220;Mobile - Normal,&#8221; might also control the wireless card.
	I thought, &#8220;Maybe there is *another* switch that controls the wireless<br />
card.&#8221; I looked along the top row of function buttons. Hmm, what&#8217;s that<br />
little antenna graphic? I pressed  F1, and since then the wireless<br />
has worked beautifully. I can even click the wireless on and off, and it<br />
functions seamlessly&#8211; no difficulties bringing the connection back up.<br />
