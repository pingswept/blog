	Not only have the jackbooted thugs overlooked me, but it appears that I have been hired to be a network administrator at an <a href="http://chewonki.org">educational foundation</a> in Maine. Mysteriously, it seems that my responsibilities, while dominated by computer stuff, will also include engineering renewable energy systems at the foundation and helping to build a cold-molded sailboat used for wilderness trips in the summer.
	I&#8217;ll be driving back and forth between Cambridge, Massachusetts, and Wiscasset, Maine, on a weekly basis. I guess I&#8217;ll have to get a new car&#8211; I don&#8217;t think <a href="http://http://www.austinev.org/evalbum/573.html">the old one</a> will make it.
