	I want to minimize the amount energy I&#8217;ll use commuting back and forth between Boston and Maine. (Say, whatever happened to the railroad?) It&#8217;s about 156 miles each way.
	The Insight is the smallest and probably the lightest car. I&#8217;d bet it&#8217;s the most aerodynamic too. On the other hand, the Prius and the TDI are much more pleasant cars in their external appearance and interiors. Also, I can make free biodiesel at the foundation for which I&#8217;ll be working.
	Emissions to worry about:<br />
Carbon dioxide<br />
Carbon monoxide<br />
Hydrocarbons<br />
Nitrogen oxides<br />
Particulate matter
	From a debate <a href="http://forums.biodieselnow.com/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=463">here</a>:
	<blockquote>
From page 53 at<br />

(these are emissions per km, so we&#8217;ll need to convert. The blue column is their measurements, the white is what VW specs. To be conservative, I&#8217;ll go with the higher numbers - the VW specs).<br />
a Golf TDI emits 0.081 g CO per km, 0.016 g of HC/km, 0.376 g of NOx per km, and 0.029 g of particulates, and 146 g/CO2 per km. To convert to per mile, divide by 0.6, and that gives, for a petro diesel powered Golf TDI, in g per mile:<br />
car________CO________HC_______NOx______CO2_______PM<br />
Golf TDI__0.135____0.0267____0.627_____243______0.483<br />
(diesel)<br />
now, using the biodiesel reductions from<br />
http://www.cityofseattle.net/cleancities/Biodiesel%202.htm<br />
So, the CO will be reduced by 50%, HCs by 93%, NOx will increase by 13%, and PM will decrease by 30%.<br />
So running on biodiesel, we now have:<br />
car________CO________HC_______NOx______CO2_______PM<br />
Golf TDI__0.065____0.0019____0.709______53.46____0.338<br />
(biodiesel)<br />
Now, compare that to a Prius or Insight from http://www.geocities.com/hevo101/impact.htm<br />
car________CO________HC_______NOx______CO2_______PM<br />
Prius_____1.0______0.010______0.02______166____?<br />
Insight___2.1______0.055______0.07______129____?<br />
bioTDI____0.065____0.0019____0.709______53.46____0.338</blockquote>

Here&#8217;s the actual certification test results by the NREL.<br />
One of the national labs that does emission testing for the EPA.<br />
actual test results for:<br />
Toyota Prius<br />
Emissions (g/mi)<br />

0.009-0.116-0.003-158<br />
PM will be tested in the 2004 Tier-II certification.<br />
Toyota has indicated the actual PM will be about half of the .01g/mi limit.

	Maybe I&#8217;ll take the bus.
