	Jason of Real Linux Geek <a href="http://real-linux-geek.blogspot.com/2005/11/massachusetts-makes-smart-move.html">mentions</a> that OpenOffice.org is available for many more platforms than Microsoft Office. He mentions that it runs on &#8220;Windows 9x/Me/XP/NT/2000, Linux, Macintosh, FreeBSD and Solaris.&#8221;
	As someone in charge of buying office suites for a largely Mac institution, I&#8217;m sad to say that the status of OOo on the Mac is tenuous at best. There is a version that runs under X11, which requires an additional installation and a little user education; what&#8217;s more, it runs slow as a dog. A really slow dog. Maybe a dog that was towing a sledge of bricks.
	The other Mac version is NeoOffice/J, which in my experience, is slightly faster, but the project, while a valiant effort, hasn&#8217;t released version 2.0 yet. Version 1.1, which I&#8217;ve used for a few months, is decent, but still slow compared to Microsoft Office. On the other hand, it doesn&#8217;t make me want to gouge my eyes out.
	At the recent OpenOffice convention, <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2005/10/01/Open-Office-Conference#p-1">according to Tim Bray</a>, a Mac port of OOo using Cocoa will be attempted soon. Sounds like I&#8217;ve heard that before somewhere.
