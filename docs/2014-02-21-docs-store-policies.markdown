## Shipping ##

All orders will ship by the end of the next business day via UPS Ground. Delivery times in the US range from 1-5 days. When your order has shipped, you will receive an email with a tracking number that you can use to track your order as it approaches your location.

## Refunds ##

If you buy something from Rascal Micro, and you don't like it, send it back within 30 days from when you placed your order, and we'll refund your money. Please include a note about the problem, along with any debugging information you can provide. Refunds beyond 30 days will require the use of a time machine.

Please attempt to be reasonable. If you "don't like it" because you stepped on it, and now it's broken, you can still send it back, but you'll probably get made fun of on the internet.

## Change log ##
