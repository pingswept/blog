## PCB for the Precision Voltage Shield ##

**Dimensions**

2.5" x 2.5" x 1/16" (roughly 64 x 64 x 1.6 mm)

The PCB has a 2.5" square footprint, but the main body is only 2.1" wide, with two 0.2" wings to accommodate the screw terminals.

**Other characteristics**

The PCB is made of FR4 fiberglass, finished with a HASL-lead-free process, and complies with ROHS. The shield is red with white silkscreen.

**Versions**
Revision 0.1: September 12, 2012
Revision 0.2: February 26, 2014

The 0.2 release has the same functionality as 0.1, but some of the components have been moved around to make assembly easier.

For more information on the Precision Voltage Shield, see the [shield's main documentation page][1].
