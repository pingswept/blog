When the device is done, this is where documentation for the open source hardware stencil printer will live.

Here's a picture of the **incomplete** first prototype.

Optical breadboard is Newport SA2-08X08.

Press-fit holes for 0.250" pins in HDPE used size C drill, which is 0.242 nominal diameter. The pins pressed in nicely with an arbor press.

Positioning bolts thread into PEM nuts KFS2-0420, also known as McMaster 94648A370. In HDPE, these nuts press nicely into a nominal 0.328" hole, which is a 21/64" drill. I use the nuts because threads in HDPE don't last very long (or at least I fear they would get gummed up).
