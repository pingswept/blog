### The Rascal is a small computer for art and science. ###

<img src="/img/rascal-iso-cropped.jpg">

The Rascal is a small, open source computer that works with Arduino shields. Inside, it runs Linux, and you can program it in Python. The Rascal comes with a web-based editor and lots of examples that you can modify to make whatever you want.

Let's say that again in a list.

 * Open source computer that works with Arduino shields
 * Programmable in Python
 * Serves webpages
 * Web server includes an editor

If you're an artist or scientist who needs a little more horsepower than the Arduino can provide, and you like the idea of hacking up web pages to make your own interface, the Rascal is for you.
