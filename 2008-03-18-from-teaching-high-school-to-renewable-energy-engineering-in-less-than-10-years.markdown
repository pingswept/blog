title: From teaching high school to renewable energy engineering in less than 10 years
---
<blockquote>"Ultimately, my goal is to work at a small engineering company developing alternative transportation technology-- projects like the solar car, but more practical."</blockquote>

That was the first sentence of the second paragraph my graduate school application essay, submitted July 27, 1999.

7 years and 1 month later (August 27, 2006), I started working at <a href="http://www.greenmountainengineering.com">GreenMountain Engineering</a>. It took another 5 months before I was actually working on an alternative transportation project (a battery pack for a hybrid bus). I developed the goal a year or two before applying to graduate school. In total, it was a few months less than 10 years ago that I decided I wanted to do more or less what I'm doing now.

Maybe engineering is easier than <a href="http://norvig.com/21-days.html">programming</a>.

Ten years from now? I hope that some of my efforts will have been successful. I hope it won't be normal for my fellow Americans to drive cars with an<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_economy"> average fuel economy</a> of less than 30 miles per gallon, and I hope that some of <a href="http://fiveislandsorchard.wordpress.com/2008/01/04/free-energy-lunch/">our 140 servants</a> will have been replaced with renewable sources of energy.

A more modest hope, given <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_subprime_mortgage_financial_crisis">the hullabaloo on Wall Street</a> this week, is that I'm not compelled to load up on handtools and firearms and head to the tropics before the Hard Times arrive.

Gotta focus on "losing the apocalyptic mindset," in the words of a friend . . .
