title: Quotes from a former career
---

In the late 90’s, I was a high school math teacher in San Francisco. A young mathematical enthusiast by the name of Enrique was kind enough to write the document below. Those were some fine times– I was even younger and more foolish than I am now.

A few notes of attribution: the bingo line was actually stolen from a high school science teacher of mine, and the line about Jesus swimming on land was more or less stolen from a King Missile song.

I think my personal favorite is, “This is America; if you don’t like it, go back to England!” I have reused this line several times in recent years. Mistaking the modern world for colonial times is a rich, satisfying experience for those of us whose humor is focused on changes in reference frame. It also provides chances to employ one of my all-time favorite lines (from Finn Smith, referring to the Esther Forbes classic Johnny Tremain): “a story about a jingoistic colonial with a crippled hand.”

Anyway:

“Mr. Stafford was my algebra teacher during my sophomore year in high school. He is now getting a graduate degree or something. He majored in English, but because of a lack of room, he was forced to become a math teacher. Because of this, he claims he can feign ignorance on any subject. He can tell anyone that he doesn’t know something because he majored in English. If the topic is English, he could say, ‘Hey, I don’t know. I’m a math teacher.’ Kooky guy. He was/is damn funny. Over the course of the year, if I had a pen or pencil I wrote down funny things he said. Everyone has a right to bask in his humor, so enjoy.”
