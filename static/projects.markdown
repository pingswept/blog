Here are some different things I've built over the last 20 years or so.

**The early years**
-------------------

*Halfpipe*

In the summer of my 16th year, I built a halfpipe in my parents' backyard. It was 16 feet wide and 25 feet long. Strangely, I didn't make any drawings before I built it-- I just thought about it a lot and calculated the right board lengths as I was building. Building skateboard ramps was how I learned that a two-by-four is stiffer in bending on edge than laid flat.

*Furniture*

For a few years in the late 90's, I was a high school math teacher in San Francisco. I owned no furniture, but I did have a circular saw, a jigsaw, and a cordless drill. Within a few weeks, I had built all the furniture in my apartment except a desk chair.

Some of it was weird, like this hybrid bookcase/desk.

(The skull candle sitting on top was the prize for the Best Halloween Costume, which I won at work that year.)

The desk was a clone of one I built in college.

*Solar-powered car*

Along with Oliver, Dorian, and some of the other solar car zealots around San Francisco, I designed and built a solar-powered car. We raced it from Washington, DC, to Orlando, Florida, in the summer of 1999. This project is what convinced me that I needed to switch professions from teaching to engineering.

**Early career**
----------------

*A device for programming mice*

This is the first device I made as an engineer for money, circa 2000. I was the inaugural summer intern at MindTribe Engineering; I spent a good eight weeks making five instances of this box, which programmed wireless mice with the codes that made them broadcast at different frequencies in different countries. It was based around the legendary Motorola 68HC11. I hand-soldered the 74HC244 output buffers needed to drive the LEDs.

*LCD driver*

Around 2002, Iowa Thin Film Technologies (now PowerFilm Solar) figured out how to make an LCD that turned clear, rather than dark, when power was lost. I built the analog drive circuitry for a motorcycle helmet that used a photocell to darken the visor as the light brightened. So far as I can tell, the product never made it to market.

*A rackmount power strip controlled through the internet*

The picture below shows me assembling a prototype of a massive 40 amp power strip that you can control through the internet. It's the first commercial product I worked on, and it's still for sale today, though I suspect that the manufacturer is no longer using the Rabbit 2000 microprocessor we used. This was also the first product I took through UL 60950 and FCC certification.

*Nikon flexure*

*Laser eye surgery machine*

I was the mechanical designer on for the concept development stage of this product for Alcon when I was at Ideo in 2005. From what I can tell, it never made it to market. From what I can tell, Alcon issued a massive product recall of this system's predecessor and then decided they were better off buying the next closest competitor (Wavelight) than building the machine themselves.

**More recent work**
--------------------

For the last few years, I've been designing machines for the renewable energy industry. Most of what I've built is secret, but here are a few photos that give you a taste without revealing too much.

*A cellulosic ethanol continuous fermentation system*

Never before have so many months of my work hung in a position so precarious.

*A test system for a large PCB, using another large PCB*

*Solar cell loom loader*

One of the machines I'm most proud of was just shipped to China a few weeks ago (spring 2010). It loads wires into looms for making photovoltaic modules.

**On the side**
---------------

*Electric Porsche*

I bought a 1973 Porsche 914 from a guy down the street and converted it to electric power.

*Pysolar*

I wrote an open source Python library for calculating the location of the sun relative to the earth.

It's called [Pysolar](http://pysolar.org).

*A plywood castle*

After an unfortunate disagreement with the city of Cambridge about what constitutes a temporary structure for protecting your car from the weather, I ended up with some excess plywood. Hence, we built a castle.

*A level floor*

*A zipline at my brother's house*

My brother discovered a grown-over grass tennis court in the woods near his house. We decided it would be best to arrive by zipline.

*Sandhill Challenge car*

*Diving board*

The most massive piece of wood I have ever worked was this piece of ash.
