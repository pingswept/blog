I’m Brandon Stafford. Thanks for reading. If you wish, you can send electronic messages to brandon at pingswept, provided you can deduce how one might form an RFC5322-complaint email address from the hints in this sentence and the URL of this blog.

I live with my girlfriend and imaginary cat in a purple house in Somerville, Massachusetts. A mechanical engineer by training, somehow I have become an embedded systems engineer. I work at GreenMountain Engineering, a renewable energy engineering firm near Boston (Davis Square in Somerville, to be precise). In my spare time, I fight for justice and vanquish foes.

By the way, if you’re looking for a great summer camp on the coast of Maine for your kid, Camp Chewonki is it.
