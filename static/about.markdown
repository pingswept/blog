I’m Brandon Stafford. Thanks for reading. If you wish, you can send electronic messages to brandon at pingswept, provided you can deduce how one might form an RFC5322-compliant email address from the hints in this sentence and the URL of this blog.

I live with my girlfriend and renegade cats in a purple house in Somerville, Massachusetts. A mechanical engineer by training, somehow I have become an embedded systems engineer. I work at GreenMountain Engineering, a renewable energy engineering firm near Boston (Davis Square in Somerville, to be precise). In my spare time, I fight for justice, vanquish foes, and get stung by bees.

By the way, if you’re looking for a great summer camp on the coast of Maine for your kid, [Camp Chewonki] [1] is it. I worked there for ten years or so, and I think very highly of the place and the people who run it.
